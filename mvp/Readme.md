## Installation and Setup

### React Extension

To run the extension, follow these steps:

`cd mvp/frontend`
1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

Alternatively, if you don't want to run the server locally, you can load the extension from the pre-uploaded `dist` folder.

### Backend and Web App
To run the backend, follow these steps:

`cd mvp/backend`
1. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `python3 asgi.py` to start the development server.


If you're running the backend locally, you need to replace the calls in the front-end
