But if his business is not amusement but art, the object at which he is aiming is not to produce a preconceived emotional effect on his audience but by means of a system of expressions, or language, composed partly of speech and partly of gesture, to explore his own emotions: to discover emotions in himself of which he was unaware, and, by permitting the audience to witness the discovery, enable them to make a similar discovery about themselves.score0.8137383680409584
A person expressing emotion, on the contrary, is treating ART PROPER: (1) AS EXPRESSION int himself and his audience in the same kind of way; he is making his emotions clear to his audience, and that is what he is doing to himself.score0.812899463147162
Art proper, as expression of emotion, has nothing to do with all this, The artist proper is a person who, grappling with the problem of expressing a certain emotion, says, ‘I want to get this clear.’score0.8055349508779787

If he attaches any THE ARTIST AND THE COMMUNITY 315 importance to the judgement of his audience, it can only be because he thinks that the emotions he has tried to express are emotions not peculiar to himself, but shared by his audience, and that the expression of them he has achieved (if indeed he has achieved it) is as valid for the audience as it is for himself.score0.7933502696053487
Here the so-called artist knows in advance what kind of emotion he wishes to excite, and will construct works of different kinds according to the different kinds of effect they are to produce.score0.7919846227973127

The artist (although under the spell of in- dividualistic prejudices he may try to deny it) stands thus in collaborative relations with an entire community; not an ideal community of all human beings as such, but the actual community of fellow artists from whom he borrows, execu- tants whom he employs, and audience to whom he speaks.score0.7855200902383306
In so far as the artist feels all this (and an artist who did not feel it would not feel the craving to publish his work, or take seriously the public’s opinion of it), he feels it not only after his work is completed, but from its inception and throughout its composition.score0.7853900254633961
But this is one of the many points in which the technical theory does not so much miss the truth as misre- present it, An artist need not be a slave to the technical theory, in order to feel that his audience’s approbation is relevant to the question whether he has done his work well or ill.score0.7852545763773044
When it is said that the artist in the proper sense of that word is a person who expresses his emotions, this does not mean that if he is afraid he turns pale and stammers; if he is angry he turns red and bellows; and so forth.score0.7833083049938608

We may call it, if we like, the specific feeling of having successfully expressed ourselves; and there is no reason why it should not be called a specific aesthetic emotion.score0.7799266259968931
It implies, first, that artists have emotions of various kinds, among which is this peculiar aesthetic emo- tion; secondly, that they select this aesthetic emotion for expression.score0.776749729269112
When, speaking of a work of art (tune, picture, &c.), we mean by art aspecific craft, intended as a stimulus for produc- ing specific emotional effects in an audience, we certainly mean to designate by the term ‘work ofart’ something that we should callreal.score0.7763841185317926
1n so far as the artist feels himself at one with his audience, this will involve no condescension on his part; it will mean that he takes it as his business to express not his own private emotions, irrespectively of whether any one else feels them or not, but the emotions he shares with his audience.score0.7744244447117056
The reason why this inevitably produces bad art is that, as we have already seen, it can only be done when the person selecting already knows what his emotions are; that is, has already expressed them.score0.7735678186345335

The audience is perpetually present to him as a factor in his artistic Iabour; not as an anti-aesthetic factor, corrupting the sincerity of his work by considerations of reputation and reward, but as an aesthetic factor, defining what the problem is which as an artist he is trying to solve—what emotions he is to express—and what constitutes a solution of it.score0.77016397642332

The poet, therefore, in proportion as he understands his business, gets as far away as possible from merely labelling his emotions as instances of this or that general kind, and takes enormous pains to individualize them by expressing them in terms which reveal their difference from any other emotion of the same sort.score0.7679623311157046

With this question we come to the subject of the audience, for the audience consists of anybody and everybody to whom such records are significant, Tt means that the picture, when seen by some one else or by the painter himself subsequently, produces in him (we need not ask how) sensuous-emotional or psychical experi- ences which, when raised from impressions to ideas by the activity of the spectator’s consciousness, are transmuted into a total imaginative experience identical with that of the painter.score0.7655511253932685

Instead of setting up for the great man who (as Hegel said) imposes upon the world the task of understanding him, he will be a humbler person, imposing upon himself the task of understanding his world, and thus enabling it to understand itself, In this case his relation to his audience will no longer be a mere by-product of his aesthetic experience, as it still was in the situation described in the preceding section; it will be an integral part of that experience itself.score0.7632967386087693

116 ART PROPER: (1) AS EXPRESSION If the difference between tragedy and comedy is a difference between the emotions they express, it is not a difference that can be present to the artist’s mind when he is beginning his work; if it were, he would know what emotion he was going to express before he had expressed it.score0.7613540176147344

Any kind of selection, any decision to express this emotion and not that, is inartistic not in the sense that it damages the perfect sincerity which distinguishes good art from bad, but in the sense that it represents a further process of a non-artistic kind, carried out when the work of expression proper is already complete.score0.7582612347113962

There may be some ground for that opinion if acting is not an art but a craft, and if the actress’s object in that scene is to produce grief in her audience; and even then the conclusion would follow only if it were true that grief cannot be produced in the audience unless symptoms of grief are exhibited by the performer.score0.754008284250886
